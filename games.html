                <span class="description">Back Home was the game I have developed for Global Game Jam 2019 which succesfully won the "Best Use of a Theme" award by majority of the votes. In the game, the player becomes a homeless person and the main objective is to collect enough money to fly back to his home country to see his mom again. The game introduces build-in random event system making collecting money easier or harder depending on the event.  </span>

                <span class="description">Uprising 1944 was another game for which I received "Best Use of a Theme" award. The game takes place in Nazi-occupied Warsaw and was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance. The player starts in the sewers as a polish underground army soldier and he needs to finish few objectives eg. saving the prisoners and communicating with the government in exile in time before escaping the sewers. </span>

                <span class="description">At Global Game Jam in 2020 Ive designed game that later became called "Last Resort". Right after Chernobyl diseaser took place, there was a high risk of second, bigger explosion once the radioactive core would melt and hit the water tank under the actual reactor. Three people decided to risk their life to pump the water out of the tanks to safe milions of lifes. In this game, the player becomes one of those people and his job is to find all of the water vaults before the explosion takes place. This game also won "Best use of a theme" award.</span>
